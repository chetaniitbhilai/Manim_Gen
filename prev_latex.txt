Algebra of Sets
Sets, Classes, Collections
\(\Omega\) \(\rightarrow\) space or universal set
\(\phi\) \(\rightarrow\) empty set, Class \(\rightarrow\) set of sets
Collection \(\rightarrow\) set of classes
Example: Let \(\Omega\) be the real line \(R\) and let 
\(C_{a} = \{(a,b): b \gt a\}\) for \(a \in R\).
Then \(C_{a}\) is a class of sets for each a. 
Further \(C_{0} = \{C_{a}: a \in R \}\) is a collection.
For any two sets A, B \(\subset\) \(\Omega\), consider the relation
'A R B' if A \(\subset\) B. Then the relation 'R' is 
reflexive and transitive. It is symmetric if \(\Omega = \phi\).
If the index set I is empty, we make the
convention that \(\bigcup_{i\in I}E_i = \phi\) and \(\bigcap_{i\in I}E_i = \Omega\).

The main reason for this rather surprising
convention is that the unions become larger
with inclusion of more sets, whereas the intersections
become smaller. For example, if \(I_1\) and \(I_2\)
are two nonempty index sets, \(I_1 \subset I_2\) then 
\[
  \bigcap_{i\in I_1} E_{i} \supset \bigcap_{i\in I_2} E_{i}
\]
Hence the smallest possible index set, i.e., \(\phi\) should
lead to the largest intersection, i.e., \(\Omega\).

This convention is also consistent with De-Morgan's
laws.
